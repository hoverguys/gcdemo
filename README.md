# rehover

A rewrite of that stupid [hovercraft gamecube homebrew](https://github.com/hamcha/hovercraft).

## Compiling

You will need:
- devkitPro (w/ devkitPPC)
- Cmake
- Hopes and dreams

Step 1:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../project
make
```
Step 2: There is no step 2, use the compiled `rehover.dol` with your favorite emulator (if it's not [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/) we need to talk)
